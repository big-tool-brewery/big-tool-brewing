#Brew Your Big Tools Easily, Or Get Binaries Here

Getting clang-format isn't easy. OCLint, easier. Scan-build? You want anything from the past three months? You have to compile llvm, compiler-rt, clang, and hope to hell it works. 

This repo contains patches to make it easy to brew yourself on a Mac with standard tools, and pre-built bottles if that's your thing.

I'm working on this repo to support installation of these excellent but hard to get tools with a simple brew-tap and brew-install. Come help me!

#About

This is not a way to get LLVM. If you want the whole toolchain, you best do it yourself. This is a project to help people get three tools critical to Obj-C development in their environment quickly and painlessly.
